# Simple Syntax Highlighter for Broo


### How to Use

Change the langugage mode to Broo on the bottom right of VSCode (should happen automatically though).

### Where do I get it?

Published to the [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jma8774.broo-language).

### Disclaimer

It is not going to work 100% of the time because there will be edge cases that this simple syntax highlighter will not account for but it is good enough for me :D
